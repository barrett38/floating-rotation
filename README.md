## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following commands:

```sh
npm install
npm install dotenv
npm install axios
npm install openai
```

To start the Frontend development server, run:

```sh
npm start
```

To start the Backend server, navigate to the server directory and run:

```sh
cd server
nodemon index.js
```

Finally, get a CONNECTION_STRING (used in database.js) and a SECRET (used in Auth.js and isAuthenticated.js) token. I used Supabase for this Backend. No Supabase project currently connected.
